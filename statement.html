  </b><br>In my work, I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt to open up new interpretations of reality. Exploring subjects as diverse as fashion, 80s technology, human species my works veer between straightforward attempts to remove the veil of autonomy from signifiers, and moments of semiotic play meant to inject elements of confusion and interest.

My individual projects usually find their locus in present-day. Often they start as sources for the collection of a wide range of materials including objects, image, and video. As these elements are worked over and treated, the originating text becomes more of a framework for understanding and reimagining the specific social interests and ideologies that shape the act of interpretation itself. This process results in new work where unfamiliar combinations of semiotic modes can perform tasks like revealing the complex relationships between man and animal or upending the alienation of a corporate logo.<br><br>

  </b><br> Primarily, I use Premiere Pro to edit my projects. I incorporate a lot of found footage. In my Installation Project, I conjoined a bunch of clips together then used the magic of editing to create my own form of artwork. An aspect such as audio play a huge role for my motive behind the project. Before any project, I create a motive behind it in order to allow viewers to gain a lesson.
